                        <h2>About Me (she/her)</h2>
                        <p>As a second-year engineering student, I've been exploring my interests in technology and design in various ways through the courses that my program offers me. From a young age, I've always been interested in the ways that technology has been advancing, how it applies to me and how I can be apart of that change. I began learning how to code at the age of 11 and have decided to pursue software development as a lifelong career.</p>
                        <p>My interest in technology first started when I began playing video games. Video games were not only a source of entertainment, but they provided me with challenges that required analysis, strategy and teamwork. To me, video games have always provided a sense of comfort and relief from the issues of everyday life and I believe that they have given me valuable skills when it comes to analyzing and strategizing.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy being challenged and find myself at my happiest when I am doing something productive. However, I also enjoy taking time away from my computer by spending time with my friends and making memories. I try to cherish my years of youth as much as possible and enjoy capturing special moments through videos and pictures. I document things like my travels, skateboarding with my friends, and sometimes just everyday fun. My ultimate goal in life is to live it to its very fullest and I have every intention to do so.</p>
